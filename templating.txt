Alternative 1:
--------------
router.php:
Save the path of the requested php file before including it

contentpage.php
Before the content, have an require_once that points to the view/template page
? Possibly <?php if (require_once('...') === false) exit; ?> ?

view/template.php
Where the content is supposed to go, include the path saved from the router
? <?php exit; ?> at the end of the template ?


Alternative 2:
--------------
router.php:
Instead of outputting the requested php file, uses
	ob_start();
	include $filePath;
	$GLOBALS['page_content'] = ob_get_clean();
	require_once $GLOBALS['page_template']; //'view/template.php'
	
view/template.php:
Where the content is supposed to go, echo the global page_content variable



Either alternative should allow the content page to set variables like page title
for the template to render, or even define which template to use to begin with.
