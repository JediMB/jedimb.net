        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a Swedish ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª programmer <em>(<a href="https://cv.jedimb.net" target="_blank">actively looking for work</a>)</em> with a passion
            for coding that I've thankfully been able to reignite in recent years, after a burnout episode set me back for a while. Being born
            and raised in Sweden, I'm naturally fluent in Swedish, but I'm comfortable with and tend to default to English due to practically
            growing up on the Internet since my teenage years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Online or off, I've always been a <i>"tech wiz"</i> who's been quick to adapt to and learn new things. I've used <i>MS-DOS</i>
            and every major <i>Microsoft Windows</i> release from <i>Windows 3.1</i> through <i>Windows 10</i>, and the only reason I didn't
            upgrade to <i>Windows 11</i> years ago is because I haven't had the means to upgrade my computer to one that meets the arbitrary
            CPU and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module" target="_blank"><i>TPM 2.0</i></a> requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            But why not turn that misfortune into an opportunity to try something else instead?
        </p>
        <p>
            Since December 7, 2024, I've practically speaking been a full-time Linux user instead. While I'm not opposed to using Windows
            operating systems and keep my old installation on a separate partition for when I might need to boot into it, I've gained a
            growing appreciation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank"><i>FOSS</i></a>
            in recent years. At the moment, I'm using the very convenient <i>Debian 12</i> on my desktop PC while a home server I maintain
            runs the Debian edition of <i>Linux Mint.</i>
